MeetSomeone is the first project I completed after finishing a 4 week course in Ruby on Rails.

There are many, many features I would someday like to add:

-install mailboxer gem

-a way to allow users to reset their password

-function for users to search for other users

-function for users to filter users

-function for users to block each other

And probably more...
